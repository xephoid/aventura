				<dialog>Actually, I'm here to help you! What do you wish to know?</dialog>
				<node id="start">
					<player>What is this?</player>
					<dialog>This is Aventura, a simple dialog engine.</dialog>
					<node>
						<player>Aventura?</player>
						<dialog>Aventura means adventure in Spanish.  The platform was named after its original purpose as a tool for adventure games.</dialog>
						<node ref="start" />
					</node>
					<node>
						<player>Dialog engine?</player>
						<dialog>
							Yes.  This is an engine for creating dialog between a human and a computer program.
						</dialog>
						<node>
							<player>I'm not sure I understand.</player>
							<dialog>Well the simplest example is what we are doing right now.  You are currently using Aventura to talk to me.</dialog>
						</node>
						<node ref="start" />
					</node>
					<node id="how">
						<player>How does this work?</player>
						<dialog>The conversation we are having now is scripted via XML.</dialog>
						<node>
							<player>XML?</player>
							<dialog>XML is a popular standard for formatting data</dialog>
							<node ref="start" />
						</node>
					</node>
					<node>
						<player>What can someone do with Aventura?</player>
						<dialog>You can easily script complex and dynamic conversations with minimal training</dialog>
						<node>
							<player>How are these scripts structured?</player>
							<dialog>Think of it like a flow chart.  You start at the beginning and based on the users choices Aventura chooses the correct text to show.  It can also fire certain actions based on different events.</dialog>
						</node>
						<node>
							<player>How is this dynamic?</player>
							<dialog>Triggers can be added to the script to activate other options which where not previously available</dialog>
